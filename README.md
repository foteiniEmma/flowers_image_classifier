## Project: Create Your Own Image Classifier - TensorFlow

### Part 1 - Developing an Image Classifier with Deep Learning

In this first part of the project, you'll work through a Jupyter notebook to implement an image classifier with TensorFlow. We'll provide some tips and guide you, but for the most part the code is left up to you. As you work through this project, please refer to the rubric for guidance towards a successful submission.

Remember that your code should be your own, please do not plagiarize (see here for more information).

This notebook will be required as part of the project submission. After you finish it, make sure you download it as an HTML file and include it with the files you write in the next part of the project.

We've provided you a workspace with a GPU for working on this project. If you'd instead prefer to work on your local machine, you can find the files in the GitHub repo.

If you are using the workspace, be aware that saving large files can create issues with backing up your work. You'll be saving a model checkpoint in Part 1 of this project which can be multiple GBs in size if you use a large classifier network. Dense networks can get large very fast since you are creating N x M weight matrices for each new layer. In general, it's better to avoid wide layers and instead use more hidden layers, this will save a lot of space. Keep an eye on the size of the checkpoint you create. You can open a terminal and enter ls -lh to see the sizes of the files. If your checkpoint is greater than 1 GB, reduce the size of your classifier network and re-save the checkpoint.

### Part 2 - Building the Command Line Application

Now that you've built and trained a deep neural network on the flower data set, it's time to convert it into an application that others can use. Your application should be a Python script that run from the command line. For testing, you should use the saved Keras model you saved in the first part.

#### Specifications

The project submission must include a predict.py file that uses a trained network to predict the class for an input image. Feel free to create as many other files as you need. Our suggestion is to create a module just for utility functions like preprocessing images. Make sure to include all files necessary to run the predict.py file in your submission.

The predict.py module should predict the top flower names from an image along with their corresponding probabilities.

##### Basic usage:

```bash
$ python predict.py /path/to/image saved_model
```

##### Options:

--top_k : Return the top KK most likely classes:

```bash
$ python predict.py /path/to/image saved_model --top_k KK
```

--category_names : Path to a JSON file mapping labels to flower names:

```bash
$ python predict.py /path/to/image saved_model --category_names map.json
```

The best way to get the command line input into the scripts is with the argparse module in the standard library. You can also find a nice tutorial for argparse here.

##### Examples

For the following examples, we assume we have a file called orchid.jpg in a folder named/test_images/ that contains the image of a flower. We also assume that we have a Keras model saved in a file named my_model.h5.

##### Basic usage:

```bash
$ python predict.py ./test_images/orchid.jpg my_model.h5
```

##### Options:

Return the top 3 most likely classes:

```bash
$ python predict.py ./test_images/orchid.jpg my_model.h5 --top_k 3
```

Use a label_map.json file to map labels to flower names:

```bash
$ python predict.py ./test_images/orchid.jpg my_model.h5 --category_names label_map.json
```

#### Workspace

##### Install TensorFlow

We have provided a Command Line Interface workspace for you to run and test your code. Before you run any commands in the terminal make sure to install TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub using pip as shown below:

```bash
$ pip install -q -U "tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0b1"
```

```bash
$ pip install -q -U tensorflow_hub
```

##### Images for Testing

In the Command Line Interface workspace we have we have provided 4 images in the ./test_images/ folder for you to check your prediction.py module. The 4 images are:

- cautleya_spicata.jpg
- hard-leaved_pocket_orchid.jpg
- orange_dahlia.jpg
- wild_pansy.jpg
